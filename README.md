Player Behaviour Analysis in Gaming

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-online-gaming-behavior-dataset

Overview:  This dataset was Synthetically produced for Educational purposes.

This project focuses on analysing a simulated dataset of user data within gaming. From this analysis I will look to extract valuable insight that and use it to recommend actionable decisions.

This dataset includes a range of gameplay metrics and demographic information, as listed below:
- Age
- Gender
- Game Genre Preferences
- Weekly Playtime (derived from average game session length, and sessions played weekly)
- In game purchase activity
- Game Difficulty
- Achievements Unlocked
- Time of day preference
- Geographic location
- Player Level

The data analysis I will use combines both descriptive and predictive modelling techniques such as Linear Regression to examine the relationship between Age and playtime per week. The project also employs the use of key visualisations that portray the trends between player activity, genre popularity and players level progression across a range of demographics.
